\begin{problem}{Odd Additions}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

Cithin has noticed something interesting about addition of odd and even numbers:
\begin{itemize}
\item odd + odd = even
\item even + odd = odd
\item odd + even = odd
\item even + even = even
\end{itemize}
Cithin believes that odd numbers are superior to even numbers. Because of this, he refuses to add two even numbers. 

Find the number of positive integer sequences with a sum of $N$ that Cithin will be able to evaluate. 

Given a sequence of integers $a_{1}...a_{k}$ $(k > 1)$, Cithin can evaluate its sum if $a_{1} + a_{2} + ... + a_{i-1} + a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$ are not both even for all $1 \leq i \leq k - 1$.

\InputFile
The input will contain a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$).

\OutputFile
Print a single integer representing the number of positive integer sequences adding up to $N$ that Cithin will be able to evaluate. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

\Examples

\begin{example}
\exmpfile{example.01}{example.01.a}%
\exmpfile{example.02}{example.02.a}%
\end{example}

\Note
For the first example, the sums are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $1 + 1 + 1 + 1$
\item $2 + 1 + 1$
\item $1 + 2 + 1$
\item $3 + 1$
\item $1 + 3$
\end{itemize}
Note that $4$ is not included as it is not a sum of integers.
